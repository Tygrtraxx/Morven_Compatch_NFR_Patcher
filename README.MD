# Morven Compatch: No Fevour Rebalance (NFR) Patcher

**Morven Compatch NFR Patcher** is a mod for [Crusader Kings III](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1158310/Crusader_Kings_III/) designed to disable a problematic mod from [Morven's Mods Compatch](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3001489429). The original mod unbalances the game by triggering heresy when favor is either too high (over 85%) or too low (under 50%), unfairly penalizing religions regardless of their performance. This patcher aims to restore balance and improve gameplay.

## How It Works

Rather than directly modifying the original mod's files (which can be overwritten by updates), this patcher:
- **Copies the mod files:** Creates a duplicate in your mods folder.
- **Applies targeted modifications:** Patches only the specific files that cause the imbalance.
- **Keeps the original intact:** This way, you can always reinstall the unmodified mod if needed.

## Installation & Usage

1. **Download the Patch:**  
   Get the latest release of the Morven Compatch NFR Patcher from our [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Tygrtraxx/Morven_Compatch_NFR_Patcher/releases).

2. **Configure Folders:**  
   - **Steam Folder:** Point to your Steam (or SteamApps) installation folder.
   - **Mods Folder:** Specify your mods folder, usually located in:  
     `Documents/Paradox Interactive/Crusader Kings III`

3. **Run the Patcher:**  
   Launch the patcher and click the **Patch** button. The tool will:
   - Copy the necessary mod files.
   - Apply the fixes to disable the unbalanced heresy triggers.

4. **Update Your Mods:**  
   To avoid conflicts, uninstall the original Morven's Mods Compatch mod. The patcher will output a new, patched version in your mods folder. Enable the patched mod in your mod manager.

5. **Enjoy:**  
   Start Crusader Kings III and experience a more balanced gameplay experience!
