# Morven Compatch : No Fevour Rebalance(NFR) Patcher

Morven Compatch NFR Patcher is a mod for [Crusader Kings III](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1158310/Crusader_Kings_III/) that patches out 
one of the mods in [Morven's Mods Compatch](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3001489429) that I found to be not fun. 

The reason I decided to patch out this mod is because being over 85% fevour led to heresys while also being under led to heresys. 
So religions that were doing really well, were essentially punished, along with religions doing really bad.

## Instructions

1: Download the Morven Compatch : NFR Patcher.
2: Select where your Steam/steampapps folder location is.
3: Select where your mods folder is. (Typically in Documents/Paradox Interactive/Crusader Kings III). 
4: Click the Patch button to patch his mod.
5. If the patch was successful, you can then uninstall his mod and there should be a new patched version located in your mods folder.
6. Enable the patched version of his mod and it will behave like his mod, but without that 1 mod.
7. Enjoy!
